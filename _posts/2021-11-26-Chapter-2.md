I was surprised at how image recognizers learn to see different patterns in different
layers of the CNN (page 34 - 36 in the book). I found it amazing to get an idea of
what's going on inside the model when it is classifying images.

I was also pleased that there is a focus in the course on the ethics of how to use
Machine Learning systems, for example the discussion of how 'predictive policing'
algorithms can cause a feedback loop and reinforce existing biases. For example in the
US there is a bias in arrest rates based on race, and predictive policing algorithms
could reinforce these biases.
