<h2 id="choosing-between-fast_template-and-fastpages">Choosing between fast_template and fastpages</h2>
<p>In Appendix A the <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Deep-Learning-Coders-fastai-PyTorch/dp/1492045527">course
book</a>
suggests using <a href="https://github.com/fastai/fast_template">fast_template</a>. It also
suggests looking on the <a href="https://course.fast.ai/">course website</a> for the latest blog
recommendations. I couldn’t see any blog recommendations on the course website, so I
searched the forum and found a <a href="https://forums.fast.ai/t/about-the-nbdev-fastpages-category/61743">post by
Jeremy</a> which
explains the difference between <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">fast_template</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">fastpages</code>. It sound like
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">fastpages</code> has all the features of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">fast_template</code> as well as extra automation and
features, so I decided to give it a go.</p>

<h2 id="setting-up-my-blog-using-fastpages">Setting up my blog using fastpages</h2>
<p>To set up my blog I followed the <a href="https://github.com/fastai/fastpages#setup-instructions">Setup
instructions</a>. The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0boq3zqazI&amp;ab_channel=1littlecoder">video
tutorial</a> by Abdul
Majed which they linked had some extra details which were helpful.</p>

<h2 id="writing-blog-posts-locally-on-my-computer">Writing blog posts locally on my computer</h2>
<p>Page 555 of the book suggests using GitHub Desktop in order to write blog posts locally.
Because I’ve used git before, I instead cloned the repository and am writing this in VS
Code.</p>
