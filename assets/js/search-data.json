            "content": "Thoughts after Chapter 2 . I was surprised at how image recognizers learn to see different patterns in different layers of the CNN (page 34 - 36 in the book). I found it amazing to get an idea of what’s going on inside the model when it is classifying images. . I was also pleased that there is a focus in the course on the ethics of how to use Machine Learning systems, for example the discussion of how ‘predictive policing’ algorithms can cause a feedback loop and reinforce existing biases. For example in the US there is a bias in arrest rates based on race, and predictive policing algorithms could reinforce these biases. .",

It also suggests looking on the course website for the latest blog recommendations. I couldn’t see any blog recommendations on the course website, so I searched the forum and found a post by Jeremy which explains the difference between fast_template and fastpages. It sound like fastpages has all the features of fast_template as well as extra automation and features, so I decided to give it a go. . Setting up my blog using fastpages . To set up my blog I followed the Setup instructions. The video tutorial by Abdul Majed which they linked had some extra details which were helpful. . Writing blog posts locally on my computer . Page 555 of the book suggests using GitHub Desktop in order to write blog posts locally. Because I’ve used git before, I instead cloned the repository and am writing this in VS Code. . Making the blog post format correctly . Initially my blog post looked like this: . . To get the page to format correctly I had to add Front Matter, following these instructions. .",
